                <p>Current Ongoing Exams at the University of Nigeria </p> <br>



<span class="dropcap">T</span>he University of Nigeria, a leading federal university in Nigeria, is presently in the thick of its examination period for the 2024/2025 academic session. As lectures for various faculties have drawn to a close, students are now engaging in both departmental and inter-faculty exams, marking a pivotal phase of their semester journey.<br>



Exam Schedule & Structure <br>

The university’s academic calendar was updated ahead of time to accommodate the examination timeline, <br> showing that exams often begin shortly after a revision period.<br>

For the first semester, departmental exams are set to hold over two days, followed by inter-faculty <br> and interdisciplinary exams that stretch over the subsequent weeks.<br>

In many departments, computer-based tests (CBT) are in use — for example, students in the Physics department <br> are expected to write the CBT exam for PHY 118: General Physics for Physical Sciences III under the second semester schedule.<br>

The university’s management also occasionally releases adjustment notices for exam timetables, ensuring <br>that unforeseen conflicts or scheduling overlaps are resolved in time.
 <br>
 <br>


 <strong>Challenges & Considerations</strong> <br>

<ul>Given that many exams now use computer-based formats, infrastructure reliability (power, network, and hardware) becomes critical. Any failure in these systems could disrupt the process or delay exams.</ul>

<ul>With tight schedules across departments and faculties, coordination is essential. Departments must align so that students sitting in multiple courses do not suffer exam clashes. </ul>

<ul> Some students may face academic or administrative hurdles — such as result upload delays, course registration issues, or departmental disputes — which can complicate their ability to fully participate.</ul>
<br>

<strong>What Students Should Expect & Do</strong> <br>

<ul>Check your timetable often: Because adjustments can occur, staying updated via the university portal or departmental notice boards is vital.</ul>

<ul>Prepare for CBT conditions: If your exam is computer-based, make sure you are comfortable with the format, have practiced typing or navigating online exam platforms, and have checked the system requirements.</ul>

<ul>Use revision weeks wisely: Before exams officially begin, a dedicated revision period helps students consolidate knowledge and manage stress.</ul>

<ul> Have backup plans: Ensure your device, power, and internet (if needed) are stable in advance. Be ready for contingencies.</ul>

<ul> Adhere strictly to exam rules: Universities often enforce strict disciplinary measures for cheating, unauthorized materials, or procedural disobedience during exams.</ul>
